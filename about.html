        <h1>How it all started</h1><br>
        <p>
            My journey into fitness did not as a sudden revelation, but as a gradual discovery of strength, resilience, and joy. Initially, it was about general well-being, but it quickly transformed into a deep passion that reshaped my daily life. I remember early on in my teenage years hows I laid on my bedroom floor watching petite girls doing pilates and copying them. Then I started with regular gym visits in the summer of 2022, drawn to the structured environment and the tangible progress in strength training.
        <br>
        
            The gym became my sanctuary, a place to push physical limits, build discipline, and witness my own progress. And along the ride I became fond of walking and exploring, slow movements that tranquils my body and mind. It became a powerful form of active meditation.
        <br>
            For me, fitness isn't just about physical health; it's a holistic practice that nurtures my mind and spirit. My journey is ongoing, always seeking new ways to challenge myself and explore the capabilities of the human body. I hope to continue exploring new trails, setting new personal bests, and inspiring others to find their own joy in movement.
